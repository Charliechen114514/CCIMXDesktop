Here is the module description for developers to refer to if you wish to modify the module for better portability to your embedded device.\hypertarget{md__components-explain-_e_n_autotoc_md41}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{🔧 {\ttfamily app\+\_\+wrapper}}{🔧 {\ttfamily app\+\_\+wrapper}}}\label{md__components-explain-_e_n_autotoc_md41}


Application launcher and system bootloader. It initializes the Qt environment, sets global styles, and manages startup and shutdown order.

Contains core system tools and default utilities embedded in the desktop environment.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily core/icm20608}  Driver and logic for the {\bfseries{ICM-\/20608 IMU sensor}}, handling real-\/time data acquisition from the gyroscope and accelerometer, connected via an I2C interface. (Additional note\+: if you use a different chip, you should also modify and rewrite the internal functions)
\item {\ttfamily gadgets}  User-\/friendly widgets, such as clocks, CPU/network meters, or quick-\/start tiles for user interaction.
\item {\ttfamily page}  Logical page management for internal UI routing (e.\+g. switching between home page, app page, etc.).
\item {\ttfamily sources/localweather}  Weather information provider for getting or simulating local weather data.
\item {\ttfamily sources/netcard}  Used to handle network card information, status display, and possibly provide IP/network diagnostics.
\item {\ttfamily ui}  UI components specific to built-\/in modules, these files support the UI style of the desktop itself.
\end{DoxyItemize}

System-\/level services and shared base classes, such as global context management, signal buses, or singleton infrastructure. May contain system abstractions used across modules.

Third-\/party or user-\/extensible applications that are integrated into the desktop system, but modularized for easy addition/removal. You need to go to the corresponding document below to read the details. It should be noted that you only need to modify these sub-\/items in extern\+\_\+app to run them independently with almost zero cost, and improve and refine them as your own project.

The Ui resources used by the desktop itself. If you need to replace them with your own resources, just replace them with the same name.

Top-\/level UI template, theme or layout definition. Can be used as the basis for the entire desktop style or skin.
