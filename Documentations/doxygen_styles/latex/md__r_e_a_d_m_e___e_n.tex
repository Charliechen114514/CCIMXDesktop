🔌 Hello! This is a simple desktop and utility that can be used in a variety of embedded devices. For me, it kicks off a suite tailored for the i.\+MX platform, combining built-\/in system gadgets and extensible external applications. Designed using Qt, the project is working on supporting integration with a wide range of hardware sensors and multimedia interfaces wherever possible.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e___e_n_autotoc_md15}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{🌐 Before you get started, choose your language! 🌐}{🌐 Before you get started, choose your language! 🌐}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e___e_n_autotoc_md15}

{\bfseries{CCIMXDESKTOP}} provides a lightweight, extensible desktop environment optimized for embedded systems based on the NXP i.\+MX6\+ULL platform. It includes a range of built-\/in tools, device integration layers, and third-\/party applications, all presented in a unified user interface.

 

Now, CCIMXDesktop supports one-\/click builds including\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 🏠 Basic desktop environment and application abstraction
\item 🏠 Dock\+Widget that records click frequency and dynamically adjusts
\item ℹ About App (a brief introduction to the basic situation of the desktop of this project)
\item ✏️ CCNoter (super lightweight notepad)
\item 🎨\+Simple\+Drawer (super lightweight drawing, similar to Windows "{}\+Paint"{})
\item 🔧 Builtin Apps (Indoor temperature requires that the \doxylink{class_i_c_m20608}{ICM20608} driver has been mounted and is available. Other sensors need to modify the interface content by themselves (just rewrite how to read) and network degree detection (requires Qt Networks Core to be supported))
\item ☀️ Weather\+APP (requires your device to be connected to the Internet to be available)
\item 📄 pdf\+Reader (requires you to have the dependent static library of mupdf on your platform)
\item 📁 File\+Ramber (file browser, with basic file navigation, Tiny version of Windows Explorer.\+exe)
\item 📷 General\+Local\+Camera (this is a basic camera based on Opencv Video\+Capture, which can realize the photo function)
\item 📊 System\+State (view the CPU status, memory capacity status and process list of the running machine)
\item 🎵 \doxylink{class_media_player}{Media\+Player} (requires your QMedia\+Player to support ALSA or other audio playback, video playback requires Open\+CV support)
\item 💡 \doxylink{class_l_e_d_controller}{LEDController} App (switch light APP, requires Platform LED driver to be enabled)
\item 🌡️ Environment App (AP3216C driver needs to be mounted)
\item 🏃 Sport\+Health App (\doxylink{class_i_c_m20608}{ICM20608} driver needs to be mounted)
\item 🛜 Network viewing assistant (supports network card information viewing, IP port scanning and basic test IP connection capability)

For beginners mapping a basic desktop, the embedded device should support Qt6 core widgets and core networking. In addition, TSLIB and Linux framebuffer backends for display should also be ready.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e___e_n_autotoc_md20}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{🛠️ Full build of technologies}{🛠️ Full build of technologies}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e___e_n_autotoc_md20}
