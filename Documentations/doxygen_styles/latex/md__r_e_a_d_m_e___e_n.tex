🔌 Hello! This is a simple desktop and utility that can be used in a variety of embedded devices. For me, it started a suite tailored for the i.\+MX platform, combining built-\/in system gadgets and extensible external applications. Designed with Qt, the project is supporting integration with various hardware sensors and multimedia interfaces as much as possible.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e___e_n_autotoc_md15}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{🌐 Before you start, choose your language! 🌐}{🌐 Before you start, choose your language! 🌐}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e___e_n_autotoc_md15}

{\bfseries{CCIMXDESKTOP}} provides a lightweight, extensible desktop environment optimized for embedded systems based on the NXP i.\+MX6\+ULL platform. It includes a range of built-\/in tools, device integration layers, and third-\/party applications, all presented in a unified user interface.

 

Now, CCIMXDesktop supports one-\/click building including\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 🏠 Basic desktop environment and application abstraction
\item 🔧 Builtin Apps (Indoor temperature requires that the \doxylink{class_i_c_m20608}{ICM20608} driver has been mounted and is available, and other sensors need to modify the interface content by themselves (just rewrite how to read) and network degree detection (requires Qt Networks Core to be supported))
\item ☀️ Weather\+APP (requires your device to be able to connect to the Internet to be available)
\item 📄 pdf\+Reader (requires you to have the dependent static library of mupdf on your platform)
\item 📁 File\+Ramber (file browser, with basic file navigation, Windows Tiny version of Explorer.\+exe)
\item 📷 General\+Local\+Camera (This is a basic camera based on Opencv Video\+Capture, which can realize the photo function)
\item 📊 System\+State (View the CPU status, memory capacity status and process list of the running machine)
\item 🎵 \doxylink{class_media_player}{Media\+Player} (Your QMedia\+Player needs to support ALSA or other audio playback, and video playback requires Open\+CV support)
\item 💡 \doxylink{class_l_e_d_controller}{LEDController} App (Light switch APP, requires Platform LED driver to be enabled)
\item 🌡️ Environment App (AP3216C driver needs to be mounted)
\item 🏃 Sport\+Health App (\doxylink{class_i_c_m20608}{ICM20608} driver needs to be mounted)

For beginners mapping a basic desktop, the embedded device should support Qt6 core controls and core networking. Additionally, TSLIB and Linux framebuffer backends for display should be ready.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e___e_n_autotoc_md20}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{🛠️ Full build of technologies}{🛠️ Full build of technologies}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e___e_n_autotoc_md20}
